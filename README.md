# ML-Spark

✅ Summary of Project: Bank Marketing Prediction with ML Pipeline
🚀 Just wrapped up a machine learning project using Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and imbalanced-learn to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on bank marketing campaign data.

We went from raw data to production-ready pipeline, performing:

🔍 Data Cleaning & EDA
🛠 Feature Engineering
⚙️ Preprocessing Pipelines (One-Hot Encoding + Standard Scaling)
🧠 Model Training: RandomForest, GradientBoosting, XGBoost
🧪 Evaluation using F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix
🔁 Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
🔍 Feature Importance Analysis
🧬 Class Balancing with SMOTE

📊 Performance Highlights (Best Model - XGBoost):

F1-Score: 0.89

Precision: 0.87

Recall: 0.91

Achieved a strong balance between precision and recall, crucial for marketing success targeting.

Confusion matrix visualization helped highlight misclassification patterns and class imbalance handling.

This pipeline gives interpretable outputs and is ready for deployment in real-world marketing systems. Learned a lot about model reliability, fairness, and production ML design!
